# KinomaJS Open Source Build README
The build system for KinomaJS open source software supports building for Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows targets. The build system runs on Mac OS X (Yosemite and later), Windows (7+) and Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). This document describes the host build environment required to build KinomaJS for each supported target platform, and the commands used to build an application.## Overview
KinomaJS applications are defined by a `manifest.json` file that contains the build options, a list of the extensions required by the application, and packaging instructions.
The `kprconfig6` tool generates build instructions from the application's `manifest.json` file. `kprconfig6` generates instructions for a command-line build for all targets, and an IDE project file for Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS.
The steps for building are:
1. Set up your host build environment.

2. Build the XS6 tools.
3. Build your KinomaJS application.
The host build environment is set up on the computer used to perform the build.

* Building KinomaJS for Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Kinoma Element (MW302), or the Kinoma Code IDE requires a Mac OS X build host.
 
* Building KinomaJS for Linux (for example, GTK desktop, Kinoma Create, or embedded Linux platforms) requires a Linux build host.
 
* Building KinomaJS for Windows requires a Windows build host.
The host build environment is set up once. Instructions for setting up the host build environment for each target platform are provided below.
The XS6 tools built in the second step interpret the `manifest.json` file that defines an application to generate build instructions. 

## kprconfig6 Tool

The XS6 tool used to build applications is `kprconfig6`.

### Using kprconfig6
To invoke `kprconfig6` to build a KinomaJS application, use:
```
kprconfig6 -x -m -p <platform> <path-to-manifest.json>```

To build a debug version of the application, use:
```
kprconfig6 -d -x -m -p <platform> <path-to-manifest.json>
```where `<platform>` identifies the target platform as indicated in the sections that follow (for example, `mac` for Mac OS X or `win` for Windows).
The package created by the build is located at `{F_HOME}/bin/<platform>/<build-type>/<app-name>.tgz` (or `.app`, `.ipa`, `.apk`, and so on, depending on the target platform).
Use `-clean` to clean the target application and platform. 
```
kprconfig6 -x -m -p <platform> <path-to-manifest.json> -clean```

Use `-cleanall` to clean all applications and all platforms.
```
kprconfig6 -cleanall
```
### kprconfig6 Options

- `-d`:  Debug build (same as `-c debug`)
- `-i`:  Enable instrumentation
- `-l`:  Debug memory leaks
- `-X`:  Support xsdebug
#### Build Options

- `-g`:  Sets CMake generator (build tool used)
- `-m`:  Build the application after generating the make files
- `-x`:  Use CMake build
#### iOS Options
- `-csi`:  Code signing identity to use on iOS
- `-pp`:  Provisioning profile for iOS
#### Output Options
- `-b`:  `bin` directory
- `-o`:  Output directory to place default `bin` and `tmp` directories
- `-t`:  `tmp` directory
## Mac OS X Target

The `Kinoma Code` application is located at `${F_HOME}/bin/mac/Release/Kinoma Code.app`. You can move the application somewhere else, or run it directly with:

  ``` 
  $ open ${F_HOME}/bin/mac/Release/Kinoma\ Code.app
  ```

## Embedded Linux Targets (BeagleBone, Edison, Raspberry Pi, Pine64, Linkit7688, LeMaker Guitar, LeMaker HiKey, Odroid C2, NanoPi M1, C.H.I.P.))![icon](http://kinoma.com/img/github/linux.png)

Building KinomaJS for embedded Linux uses a Linux build host.
The build system uses `linux/beaglebone`, `linux/edison`, `linux/pi_gl`, `linux/pi`, `linux/pine64`, `linux/linkit7688`, `linux/guitar`, `linux/hikey`, `linux/odroidc2`, `linux/nanopim1`, or `linux/chip` as the target platform to build for the respective platform. The examples in this section use `linux/beaglebone`.



### Set Up Your Host Build Environment

1. Install the developer tools and CMake.
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall  $ sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libasound2-dev zlib1g-dev  $ sudo apt-get install cmake
  ```
2. For a 64-bit Linux, install 32-bit libraries.
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install zlib1g:i386 lib32stdc++6
  ```
3. Install the toolchain and `sysroot`.	To set up the cross-compilation environment and libraries for your build target:
	
	- For BeagleBone, Raspberry Pi or Edison, see the document [Setup for Building for Embedded Devices](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/blob/master/doc/EmbeddedSetup.md)  
	
	- For Pine64, LeMaker HiKey, Odroid C2, or other 64-bit arm devices, see the document [Setup for Building for Pine64](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/blob/master/doc/Pine64Setup.md)
	
	- For Linkit7688, see the document [Setup for Building for Linkit7688](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/blob/master/doc/Linkit7688Setup.md)
	
	- For LeMaker Guitar, NanoPi M1, C.H.I.P, or other 32-bit arm devices, see the document [Setup for Building for LeMaker Guitar](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/blob/master/doc/LeMakerGuitarSetup.md)
4. Get a copy of the KinomaJS source code. It can be downloaded using your web browser from the [KinomaJS repository on GitHub](http://github.org/kinoma/kinomajs) or using the `git` command-line tool, as follows:
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/kinoma/kinomajs.git
  ```5. Set up two environment variables to point to the source tree.
  ```
  $ export F_HOME=/path/to/kinomajs  $ export XS6=${F_HOME}/xs6
  ```### Build the XS6 Tools
1. Build the XS tools as follows:

  ```
  $ cd ${XS6}  $ mkdir tmp  $ cd tmp  $ cmake ${XS6}  $ cmake --build . --config Release
  ```
2. Update the `PATH` environment variable to include the path to the XS6 tools.
  ```
  $ export PATH=${PATH}:${XS6}/bin/linux/$(uname -m)/Release
  ```
3. *(Optional)* Build the `xsbug` debugger: `xsbug` is a graphical debugger used as an alternative to the Kinoma Studio debugger.
  ```
  $ kprconfig6 -p linux/gtk -x -m ${XS6}/xsbug/manifest.json
  ```
	The `xsbug` application is located at `${F_HOME}/bin/linux/gtk/Release/xsbug/xsbug`.

### Build Your KinomaJS Application

The target platform specifiers are as follows:

  - `linux/pi` - Raspberry Pi
  - `linux/pi_gl` - Raspberry Pi, using OpenGL
  - `linux/beaglebone` - BeagleBone
  - `linux/edison` - Intel Edison
  - `linux/pine64` - Pine64
  - `linux/linkit7688` - Linkit7688
  - `linux/guitar` - LeMaker Guitar
  - `linux/hikey` - LeMaker HiKey
  - `linux/odroidc2` - Odroid C2
  - `linux/nanopim1` - NanoPi M1
  - `linux/chip` - C.H.I.P.
  
1. Build the `balls` sample application that is included in the KinomaJS repository.
  ```
  $ cd ${F_HOME}  $ kprconfig6 -x -m -p linux/beaglebone ${F_HOME}/kinoma/kpr/applications/balls/manifest.json
  ```
	The `balls` application is located at `${F_HOME}/bin/linux/beaglebone/Release/Balls.tgz`.
2. Transfer the `.tgz` file to your device and decompress.

#### To allow connection to your device from Kinoma Code, build the EmbedShell application

1. Build the `EmbedShell` application

  ```
  $ cd $(F_HOME)
  $ kprconfig6 -x -m -p linux/pine64 $(F_HOME)/kinoma/kpr/projects/embed/manifest.json
  ```

	The `EmbedShell` application is located at `${F_HOME}/bin/linux/pine64/Release/EmbedShell `.2. Transfer the `EmbedShell.tgz` file to your device and decompress.

3. Run the `mdnsd` if Avahi or other mdns is not running on your target. This will allow EmbedShell to advertise itself to your local network.

   ```
	./EmbedShell/lib/mdnsd
   ```

4. Run the EmbedShell

   ```
   ./EmbedShell/EmbedShell
   ```
>**Note**: Depending on your user permissions, you may have to run mdnsd and EmbedShell as root using the sudo command.
>
> ```
> sudo ./EmbedShell/EmbedShell
> ```
