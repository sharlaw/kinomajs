#KinomaJS XML Reference

##About This Document

This document provides details on the elements that make up the optional KinomaJS XML interface. The companion document [*KinomaJS Overview*](../overview/) introduces the KinomaJS XML interface along with much more information that this document assumes you are already familiar with (including a Glossary of terms used in this document).


##KinomaJS XML Element Reference

<!--From CR: The wording shown parenthetically in the next paragraph is per Patrick; however, based on old overview material (now in the Overview doc's glossary), templates do not instantiate but rather are instantiated. Ideally this usage would be consistent. (Ditto in all similar places)-->

This section provides details on the elements that make up the optional KinomaJS XML interface. For each element, a brief description is provided. (For elements described as defining constructors or templates that create or instantiate objects, more information about the objects can be found in the 
[*KinomaJS JavaScript Reference*](../javascript/) document.) Then the following information is presented if relevant. 

#####Tag

###Transition Element

The `transition` element defines a `Transition` constructor and its prototype. Applications and shells use `Transition` constructors to create `transition` objects.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `identifier` | required |    
 
> The identifier of this `Transition` constructor
 
| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `like` | `reference` | |      
 
> A reference to a `Transition` constructor (`Transition` by default). The properties of the prototype of the referenced constructor are inherited by the prototype of the defined constructor.

###Variants Element

The `variants` element sets the variants offset of a `skin` object.

| `names` | `identifier` (1 or more, separated by commas) |  
 
> The identifiers of the variants
 
| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offset` | `number` | |    
 
> The horizontal distance between variants

###Wrap Element

The `wrap` element inserts a `content` object inside a `block` element.    

#####Tag
